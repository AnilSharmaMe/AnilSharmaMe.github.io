    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: December 14, 2025</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Spotter App (“we”, “our”, or “us”) values your privacy and is committed to protecting your information.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and safeguard information when you use the Spotter mobile application.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account & Device Information:</strong> App-specific identifiers and device information required for functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Location data used to provide alerts and mapping features.</li>
        <li><strong>Media:</strong> Images that you voluntarily upload, capture, receive, or choose to save within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Diagnostic and performance data such as feature usage and crash logs.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Face Data & Biometric Information</h2>

    <h3>What Face Data Is Collected</h3>
    <p>
        Spotter processes face data only when you explicitly choose to save a face or when a received alert image
        is processed for comparison. This may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cropped face images derived from user-selected or alert images</li>
        <li>Numerical face embeddings (mathematical vector representations)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The app does <strong>not</strong> collect names, real-world identities, biometric identifiers linked to a person,
        or government-issued identification.
    </p>

    <h3>How Face Data Is Used</h3>
    <p>
        Face data is used solely to provide core app functionality, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allowing users to maintain a private face vault on their own device</li>
        <li>Performing on-device face similarity comparisons</li>
        <li>Displaying saved face images to the user</li>
        <li>Allowing users to manage or delete saved faces</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Face data is <strong>not</strong> used for advertising, analytics, profiling, tracking, or identity verification.
    </p>

    <h3>On-Device Processing</h3>
    <p>
        All face detection, alignment, and embedding generation occurs entirely on the user’s iPhone.
        Facial embeddings are never uploaded to servers or processed in the cloud.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>User-to-User Image Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        The app allows users to share incident or alert images with other users through notifications.
        These shared images may contain faces.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shared images are delivered to other users’ devices as alerts</li>
        <li>If a recipient chooses to save a face, all face processing occurs locally on their own device</li>
        <li>Facial embeddings are never transmitted between users</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Spotter does not maintain a shared or centralized facial recognition database.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Data Storage & Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Face images and face embeddings are stored locally within the app’s secure, sandboxed storage on your device.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Face data is retained only for as long as you choose to keep it</li>
        <li>You may delete individual faces or all face data at any time within the app</li>
        <li>Deleting the app permanently removes all stored face data</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
        Spotter does not sell, rent, or share face data with third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Facial embeddings are never transmitted to external servers and are not accessible to third-party service providers.
        Information may be disclosed only if required by law or to protect legal rights.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        We apply reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect your information.
        All locally stored data benefits from iOS system-level encryption and sandboxing.
        No system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Access, review, or delete your information within the app</li>
        <li>Delete saved face data at any time</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app to permanently remove all stored data</li>
        <li>Contact us with privacy-related questions</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>

        Spotter App is not intended for children under 13.
        We do not knowingly collect personal or face data from children.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy periodically.
        Updates will be posted with a revised effective date.
