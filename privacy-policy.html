    <h2>Face Data & Biometric Information</h2>

    <h3>What Face Data Is Collected</h3>
    <p>
        The app processes face-related data only when you explicitly choose to save a face or when a face image
        is processed for comparison purposes. This data may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cropped face images derived from user-selected photos or incident alert images</li>
        <li>Numerical face embeddings (vector representations) generated on-device</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The app does <strong>not</strong> collect names, real-world identities, biometric identifiers,
        or government-issued identification.
    </p>

    <h3>How Face Data Is Used</h3>
    <p>
        Face data is used exclusively to provide core app functionality, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allowing users to maintain a private face vault</li>
        <li>Performing on-device face similarity comparisons</li>
        <li>Displaying saved face images back to the user</li>
        <li>Enabling users to manage or delete saved faces</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Face data is <strong>not</strong> used for advertising, marketing, analytics, profiling, or tracking.
    </p>

    <h3>On-Device Processing</h3>
    <p>
        All face detection, alignment, and embedding generation is performed entirely on the user’s device.
        Face data is not processed in the cloud.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Data Storage & Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Face images and derived face data are stored locally on your device within the app’s secure,
        sandboxed storage area.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Face data is retained only for as long as you keep it</li>
        <li>You may delete individual faces or all saved face data at any time within the app</li>
        <li>Deleting the app permanently removes all stored face data</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, rent, or share personal data or face data with third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Face data is never transmitted to external servers and is not accessible by third-party service providers.
        We may disclose information only if required by law or to protect legal rights.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect your information.
        All locally stored data benefits from iOS system-level encryption and sandboxing.
        However, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Access, review, or delete your stored information through the app</li>
        <li>Delete saved face data at any time</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app to permanently remove all stored data</li>
        <li>Request information about your data by contacting us</li>
    </ul>
